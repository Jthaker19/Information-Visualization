    <p>This <b>Scatter-Plot</b> shows the relation of content of Fiber from different cups of cereals. Here we have took more than 40 different types of cereals and their Fiber content related to their cup size. 
    <br>I have used <b>Zoom and Pan technique</b> to better understand the Visualization. Here I have used plotly library of Javascript. The X-axis shows cup size and Y-axis shows Fiber content.</p>
